# Windows-Development-AIO  
## NOT FUNCTIONAL YET  
A quality of life Windows utility designed to allow users to install and build languages and packages. Tailored toward beginner developers who wish to keep the installation process simple and abstract.

## Inactive Project
This project has not reached an EOL. Why, the first version hasn't been published and due to my busy schedule; development has come to a halt.
